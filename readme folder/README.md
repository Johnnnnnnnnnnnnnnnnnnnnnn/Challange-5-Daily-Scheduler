# Daily Planner and Scheduler

This is a daily planner app that I made for the bootcamp challange module 5.

It has several functionality:
1. It can save and keep whatever the user type in the textbox provided into the local storage, so that it won't disappear after the user close the application.
2. The color of the box will change depending on their respective hour.
    - if the current hour of the user has past the box's set hour, then the box will turn to the color gray indicating that it is the past.
    - if the current hour of the user is the same as the box's set hour, then the box will turn to the color red indicating that it is the present.
    - if the current hour of the user haven't past the box's set hour, then the box will turn to the color green indicating that it is the future.
3. The app can tell the current year, month, and date of the user.
